<b>Angular 6 tutorial I found online that I've corrected.</b><br>
My recent raison d'ietre is to find rogue tutorials that are wrong.

<b>Why do tutorials have such egregious errors?</b><br>
So the blogger can build subscribers. That's why. That's my theory at least. You see, I've joined websites to ask questions about why the tutorial I'm trying to follow isn't working or to point out an error. I'm unable to do leave a comment anonymously, so I need to create an account, and thereby join the mailing list to do so. It's a trap people. I'm here to stop it.
My mission is to track down and correct these errors so:
1. personal details are collected in an honest manner
2. there are better learning resources on the web
